# SourceMapInstaller
## An easy way to install maps for Source Engine games.

This tool allows you to easily copy a BSP map file into the correct folder for a game.

Note that this tool is designed for Steam installs, but feel free to clone the code and change the paths to make it work with non-steam installs.
